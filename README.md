# DitherBoy

> Seamus Mullan, 2025

DitherBoy is an open source application for creating image effects like dithering, pixelation, rendering in ASCII, etc.

Ditherboy is completely free and open source, but please consider supporting to help development, this means:

- Helping me develop DitherBoy and work on my hobbies
- Buying me ~~coffee~~ Monster
- Subscribing to my [Patreon](patreon.com/24carrrot)

## About

DitherBoy contains.... uhh nothing...

well this is awkward....uhmm....

how about you stop complaining and help commit some code, go on, the fork button is *right* there!

## Roadmap

Ideally I want DitherBoy to be a cool tool for artists to use and make their work look a little more computery, but not in the horrible AI way.

The vibes of a computer circa 1980s just hits me in the feels in a way I like. The simplicity, monotonus colours.

It still feels like theres humanity in there. So thats the goal for DitherBoy, a tool that makes things look computery and feel human.

OK so yapfest over, here's the actual information you probably want:

- Version 0.1.0
  - Super basic UI, No Backend
- Version 0.2.0
  - UI Layout defined, Small styling works

  - Mediocre UI, styling almost done, layout and UX flow thoughts now
- Version 0.4.0
  - UI Implementation finished, Implementing UX flow / thoughts

  - Frontend completed! UI/UX implemented, Styling done and all that jazz
- Version 0.6.0
  - Start backend implementation, super basic photo imports n stuff
- Version 0.7.0
  - Basic photo manipulation, HSV, Resolution, etc.
- Version 0.8.0
  - Implement 15-20 dithering algorithms, thats it
- Version 0.9.0
  - ASCII renderer, more pixelation effects, palletes
- Version 1.0.0
  - CI/CD installers / binaries
  - Official Release
  - This version will be (ideally) a stable version of the app ready for use.

## Plans after V1

Honestly, this is purely dependant on community reception. If it goes well it goes well!

> Just put the PR in the bag

Genuinely, I would rather sift through 10,000 lines of terrible **HUMAN** code than have people with AI chatbots spamming "perfect" fixes or whatever.

Follow KISS, DRY, SOLID, whatever. If it looks good, its probably good, and if it isn't, the internet will let me know...

## Support

Obviously I don't get paid to exist or make this, since it's free. It would be super cool if you subscribed to the patreon though!

[Patreon](patreon.com/24carrrot)

I'm thinking about possibly adding early access builds to there or even something like a list of custom effects people can use.
I don't wanna limit peoples art just because I wanna get paid though, so that's definitely not certain.

And if you dont like DitherBoy, that's not the only thing I have on my patreon. Go have a look!

## Thanks

Damn you read all that, or did you just scroll the whole way down to find the super easy how-to guide...

(don't worry I did too, still can't find the guide though...)

Honestly though, thanks to the people making open source happen, without you I would be so much more broke (or a piracy god, idm).

Now go get some reddit karma on whatever subreddit fetishises open source contributions...
